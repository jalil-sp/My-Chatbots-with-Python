# Iteration 1

Being someone who is currently in the process of deepening my coding
knowledge with Python I have really enjoyed these sets of bots. I chose to use the bottle
framework for all my bots as it was the recommended one to go with. I did however take
a glance at the other two and appreciate the documentation.

For my ReserveEchoBot.py deliverable, I chose to include a code that will reverse
the word order as well as a commented-out section of code that returns a mirrored message of the
original message that is sent in from the user. I’m already very familiar with splitting,
reversing, and joining a string together. In the second deliverable, YodaMatchBot.py, I
wanted to try my hand at using as many markdown methods as possible. This was new
information to me, so I learned a lot about markdowns and how to create a custom
validator. I based the bot on informing the user about some of my hobbies. The
next deliverable, InspirationBot.py, was a straightforward bot that would return a random
inspirational quote from a list of preset quotes that I decided on. Finally, my PushBot.py
deliverable is a bot that sends a few helpful reminders depending on the time of day. I
would love to learn if there is a way to have this bot running without me manually
running the code myself.

Overall, I really enjoyed these deliverables and can’t wait to continue with the future
iterations!
