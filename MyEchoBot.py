"""EchoBot Example using Bottle server.

Bottle documentation: https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/

Bottle is a 'fast, simple, and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework'.
Due to being lightweight, we will use the Bottle web-framework
for the CELL trainings.

You are welcome to use whatever framework (Bottle, Flask, FastAPI, etc.)
you want to choose when developing your assignments.
